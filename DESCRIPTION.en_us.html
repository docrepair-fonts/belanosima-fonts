    Belanosima is a DocRepair font, intended to improve compliance with the
    ISO/IEC 29500 standard by providing fallback for Berlin Sans FB that minimizes text reflow in
    Office Open XML documents. Belanosima is based on Josefin Sans, a geometric,
    elegant family with a vintage feeling, for use at larger sizes. Josefin Sans
    is inspired by geometric sans serif designs from the 1920s.
